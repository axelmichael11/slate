#Joshua Evans
I spent the last ten years working in the music industry. I owned an independent record store for much of that time. While running my business, I was always looking for ways to solve problems, often with technical solutions. I became passionate about learning coding, realizing that there were opportunities to contribute to the future of the music industry with technological applications.

Most of my experience is in the financial services industry. I am currently working on projects primarily in JavaScript, with beginner level experience in Python and SQL. I am very interested in full-stack application, using Node.js for the backend and React for the front-end.
